### [New Question](https://github.com/merrcury/ama/issues/new) :question: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read Questions](https://github.com/merrcury/ama/issues) :orange_book: 

We keep organising lots of workshops in which many question remains unanswered. Students who are new to programming have several issues. This space will answer all the queries regarding workshops, project-reviews, code-reviews, coding queries, study-material queries and almost everything in your mind. 

Guidelines: 

+ Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
+ Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
+ Use a succinct title and description.
+ I encourage use of Stack Overflow for support but If You are unable to figure out there. Feel free to ask here. 
+ Be civil and polite.
